## How to submit a talk proposal

* Create a pull request with yourself added to the next meetup announcement.
* Wait for discussion around your proposal, and optionally adjust your proposal based on the discussion.
* One of the repo committers will merge and close your PR

    **If you need any help with this process** because you are new to GitHub or git, give us a poke on Twitter. We are happy to help newcomers in any way we can!
